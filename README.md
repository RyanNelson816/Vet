# Vet
a fun database for my girlfriends studies
My end goal is to finish this project out for fun, using java
As a veterinarian, my girlfriend will see many different breeds of dogs/cats,
each requiring different treatments/doses of medicine
I'd like to write code to make all of that information easily accessible,
so that treatment of animals is easy and doesn't require memorization of doses of medicine.
